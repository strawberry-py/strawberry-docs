A wormhole extension for `strawberry.py <https://github.com/strawberry-py/strawberry-py>`_

**Strawberry Wormhole** is a Python module that adds *wormhole* functionality. A *wormhole* is a virtual bridge between channels and guilds. When a message is sent to one wormhole-enabled channel, it's automatically forwarded to all others in the same group.

The module was originally created by `The HEX <https://github.com/hex-42-52-4f>`_ and now the repository is mantained by `Fialin <https://github.com/j-fiala>`_ and `ArcasCZ <https://github.com/ArcasCZ>`_.
