Automatic threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some channels may create threads by default for every message you send.

This is used by QnA channels or other types of channels where the moderators want to allow discussions, but want to keep all their messages visible at the same time.

Bookmarks
~~~~~~~~~

You can react on any message with the emoji ðŸ”– *(:bookmark:)*.

If enabled, the bot will send you a direct message with a content of that message, including the author's name and link to the original.

You can use this to keep all your friend's jokes in one place.

User pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may not have the Manage messages permission, but you can still pin messages!

If enabled, you and other members can add the ðŸ“Œ *(:pushpin:)* emoji to any message, and if enough of you react like this, the message will get pinned.

User threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even if you don't have permission to open new threads, you can do that via the bot.

If enabled, you and other members can add the ðŸ§µ *(:thread:)* emoji to any message, and if enough of you react like this, a new thread will be opened.

Delete bot's DM messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bot can send you DMs for some interactions. When you react to its message with the ðŸ—‘ *(:wastebasket:)* emoji, the message will be deleted, cleaning up your DM history.
