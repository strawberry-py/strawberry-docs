Logging
=======

Log configuration is realized by ``logging`` commands.

All commands described on this page are provided by the ``base.logging`` module.

tl;dr
-----

To start logging guild logs with level ``INFO`` and higher into the current channel, run

.. code-block:: text

    !logging set guild INFO

To start logging all guild logs from module ``base.acl`` into the current channel, run

.. code-block:: text

    !logging set guild DEBUG base.acl

You can list current loggers by running

.. code-block:: text

    !logging list

Severity levels
---------------

There are five severity levels: ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR`` and ``CRITICAL``.

They are not evenly distributed through the codebase; majority of log messages are ``INFO`` messages.

Command overview
----------------

.. note::

    No matter the logging configuration, all logs are always being saved to offline file on your server.

.. command:: logging set <scope> <level> [module]

Start logging messages of at least ``<level>`` into current channel.

As a guild admin youâ€™ll be using the ``guild`` scope. Bot owners may be interested in ``bot`` scope.

To filter out logs from specific module into separate channel, you can specify the module filter as ``<repository name>.<module name>``. Messages filtered by specific module channel are not being sent to the generic log channel.

Messages with ``bot`` scope are replicated to all channels subscribed to the scope, messages with ``guild`` scope will not be logged in other guilds.

.. command:: logging unset <scope> [module]

Stop logging messages from given scope.

.. command:: logging list

Display currently enabled logs.
